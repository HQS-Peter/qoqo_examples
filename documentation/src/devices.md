# Devices

Devices in qoqo can be abstract devices or actual hardware devices.
* Abstract devices contain abstract information for the model of a quantum computer and its parameters.
* Actual hardware devices that are supported by roqoqo [backends](backends.md) and contain the necessary information for accessing the quantum computing hardware.

The devices also encode a connectivity model.

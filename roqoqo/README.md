# Roqoqo examples

Each example is available as a full standalone Rust program in [standalone](./standalone) and as an experimental Jupyter notebook version in [notebooks](./notebooks/).

## Rust

This directory contains roqoqo examples written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). We recommend to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs) to install the rust compiler toolchain and to manage which Rust version is used.

## Notebooks

It is possible to use Rust in Jupyter Notebooks by using [EVCXR](https://github.com/google/evcxr) crate and/or EVCXR Jupyter kernel in VSCode. 
This external [link](https://depth-first.com/articles/2020/09/21/interactive-rust-in-a-repl-and-jupyter-notebook-with-evcxr/) provides the installation instructions and information on first steps.

## Standalone

To run the standalone examples in Rust, please execute

```bash
cd ./standalone
cargo run
```
